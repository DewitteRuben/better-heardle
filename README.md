# Better Heardle

Many people are familiar with the standard Heardle that is reused all over the web.

The problem with this template is that it is just an obfuscated bundle of code that was 'copied' from one project to another.

With this project, I aim to make it easy for anyone to create their own Heardle application without having to deal with obfuscated and hard-to-read code. By simply using a generator, users can create a Heardle project with ease.
